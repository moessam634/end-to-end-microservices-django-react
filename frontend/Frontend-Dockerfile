# ---- Production Stage ----
FROM nginx:alpine

# Copy built static files from build stage to Nginx public dir
COPY --from=build /app/build /usr/share/nginx/html

# (Optional) Use a custom nginx.conf for React Router support, enable if needed:
# COPY nginx.conf /etc/nginx/nginx.conf

# Expose port 80 for the web server
EXPOSE 80

# Default command to run nginx is already correct
